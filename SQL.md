### Difference between EXISTS and IN in SQL?
<a href="https://intellipaat.com/community/3903/difference-between-exists-and-in-in-sql">Exists vs In</a><br>
Difference lies here:
```
select * 
from abcTable
where exists (select null) 
```
Above query will return all the records while below one would return empty.
```
select *
from abcTable
where abcTable_ID in (select null)
```
<strong>IN:</strong>
* Works on List result set
* Doesnâ€™t work on subqueries resulting in Virtual tables with multiple columns
* Compares every value in the result list
* Performance is comparatively SLOW for larger result set of subquery<br>
<strong>EXISTS:</strong>
* Works on Virtual tables
* Is used with co-related queries
* Exits comparison when match is found
* Performance is comparatively FAST for larger result set of subquery
### What is Cross Join in SQL?
The SQL CROSS JOIN produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table if no WHERE clause is used along with CROSS JOIN.This kind of result is called as Cartesian Product.
<br>
If WHERE clause is used with CROSS JOIN, it functions like an INNER JOIN
<br>

### SQL Self JOIN
A self JOIN is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.
<br><a href="https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/perform-a-self-join.php">Self JOIN Syntax</a><br>
```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;
```
### What is the difference between TRUNCATE, DELETE and DROP statements?
<strong>TRUNCATE</strong>
It is used to remove all the records from a table. It deletes all the records from an existing table but not the table itself. The structure or schema of the table is preserved.
* TRUNCATE Command is a Data Definition Language operation. 
### Compare differences between two tables in mysql
<a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/214365/how-to-show-difference-between-two-tables">How to show difference between two tables?</a><br>
```
SELECT tbl, ID, col
FROM
(
    SELECT
    tbl_a.ID, tbl_a.col, "name_to_display1" as "tbl" FROM tbl_a
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
    tbl_b.ID, tbl_b.col, "name_to_display2" as "tbl" FROM tbl_b
) t
WHERE ID IN (select ID from tbl_a) AND ID IN (select ID from tbl_b)
GROUP BY
ID, col
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
 ORDER BY ID
```

```
SELECT * FROM T1
WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT ID FROM T2)

UNION

SELECT * FROM T2
WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT ID FROM T1)
```
```
select t1.user_id,t2.user_id 
 from t1 left join t2 ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id 
 and t1.username=t2.username 
 and t1.first_name=t2.first_name 
 and t1.last_name=t2.last_name
//This will compare your table and find all matching pairs, if any mismatch return NULL on left.
```
### The SQL CASE Statement
The CASE statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an IF-THEN-ELSE statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.
<br>
If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.<br>
<a href="https://www.sqlshack.com/case-statement-in-sql/">CASE Syntax</a><br>
```
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END;
```
### Second Highest Salary in MySQL
```
SELECT name, MAX(salary) AS salary
  FROM employee
 WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary)
                 FROM employee); 
```
```
SELECT salary 
FROM employee 
ORDER BY salary desc limit n-1,1
```
```
SELECT
    TOP 1 salary
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            TOP 2 salary
        FROM
            employees
    ) sal
ORDER BY
    salary DESC;
```
```
select * from emp 
where sal=(select min(sal) from 
(select sal from(select distinct sal from emp order by sal desc)
where rownum<=n));
n can be the value you want to see......

select max(Emp_Sal) 
from Employee a
where 1 = ( select count(*) 
         from Employee b
         where b.Emp_Sal > a.Emp_Sal)

select max(Emp_Sal) 
from Employee a
where 1 = ( select count(*) 
         from Employee b
         where b.Emp_Sal > a.Emp_Sal)
```
### Finding duplicate values in a SQL table
```
SELECT username, email, COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY username, email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```
```
Solution 1:
SELECT *,
       COUNT(*)
FROM users t1
INNER JOIN users t2
WHERE t1.id > t2.id
  AND t1.name = t2.name
  AND t1.email=t2.email

Solution 2:
SELECT *,
       COUNT(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY name,
         email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```
### How can I remove duplicate rows?
```
DELETE 
FROM MyTable
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
              SELECT min(RowID)
              FROM Mytable
              WHERE (SELECT RowID 
                     FROM Mytable
                     GROUP BY Col1, Col2, Col3
                     ))
               );

DELETE A
FROM   TABLE A,
       TABLE B
WHERE  A.COL1 = B.COL1
       AND A.COL2 = B.COL2
       AND A.UNIQUEFIELD > B.UNIQUEFIELD

DELETE
FROM
    table_name T1
WHERE
    rowid > (
        SELECT
            min(rowid)
        FROM
            table_name T2
        WHERE
            T1.column_name = T2.column_name
    );
```
### Backup table in SQL
```
Create table Backup_Table as select * from Table_To_be_Backup where 1 = 2;

SELECT * INTO  [dbo].[tbl_NewTable] 
FROM [dbo].[tbl_OldTable]
```
### Export table from sql server to text file
```
SELECT *
FROM [AdventureWorks].[Person].[AddressType] 
INTO OUTFILE 'C:/filename.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
```
### import data from .txt file to populate a table in SQL Server
#### Using OPENROWSET
You can read text files using OPENROWSET option (first you have to enable adhoc queries)
```
Using Microsoft Text Driver
SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET('MSDASQL',
'Driver={Microsoft Text Driver (*.txt; *.csv)};
DefaultDir=C:\Docs\csv\;',
'SELECT * FROM PPE.txt')
```
#### Using OLEDB provider
```
SELECT 
    * 
FROM 
OPENROWSET
        ('Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0','Text;Database=C:\Docs\csv\;IMEX=1;','SELECT * 
FROM PPE.txt') t
```
#### Using BULK INSERT
You can import text file data to a staging table and update data from it:
```
BULK INSERT dbo.StagingTable
FROM 'C:\PPE.txt'
WITH 
  (
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ';', 
    ROWTERMINATOR = '\n' 
  )
```
