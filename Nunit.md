### :dart:PageObjects and PageFactory in C#<br> 
The PageObject Design Pattern models areas of an UI as objects within test code which can also be considered as Object Repository for Web UI Elements. The functionality classes (PageObjects) in this design represent a logical relationship between the pages of the application. Each class is referred to as a PageObjects and returns other PageObjects to facilitate the flow between pages. Page Object class is responsible to find the WebElements of that page and also hold methods that perform operations on those WebElements.
